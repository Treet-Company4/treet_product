1. Make sure you have the repository cloned as described above
2. Enter the repository by in a terminal typing ```cd product_treet```
3. Install dependencies with ```npm install```
4. Start the application with ```npm start```

This will lock the terminal and open a web-browser with the application running. The website will be running on localhost::3000.
